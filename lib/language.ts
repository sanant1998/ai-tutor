/* Which language the tutor teaches in.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS FIELD EXISTED AND DID NOTHING
 *
 * `language` has been on the subjects table and in the student snapshot since
 * the first migration, it was interpolated into the prompt as a bare string,
 * and the system prompt hard-coded one voice regardless. A student set to
 * hi-IN got the same Hinglish as everyone else. A column that is read and
 * ignored is worse than one that does not exist: it looks like a feature in
 * every code review.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY HINGLISH IS THE DEFAULT AND NOT ENGLISH
 *
 * It is what these students actually speak. "Iska additive inverse kya hoga"
 * is one sentence made of two languages, and a tutor that answers in careful
 * English is asking a thirteen-year-old to translate their own confusion
 * before they can express it.
 *
 * The other two exist because the audience is not uniform. A student in a
 * Hindi-medium school reads Devanagari faster than Latin-script Hinglish; a
 * student in an English-medium metro school may find Hinglish patronising. The
 * cost of offering all three is one instruction block.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE WITH LANGUAGE
 *
 * The mathematics, the content pack, and the misconceptions. Those are written
 * once and delivered in whichever language — which is only possible because
 * the tutor does not invent its material. Translating a curriculum is a
 * content job; translating a delivery style is a prompt.
 *
 * No "server-only": the settings screen renders these labels. */

 * Hinglish still gets Hinglish, and the instruction block above is untouched.
